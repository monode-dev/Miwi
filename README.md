# Miwi

The UI library used in all Monode projects. It's a super early work in progress.

Update using: `npm install miwi@latest`

## miwi/b-x

An alternate to `<div>` with a custom styling language. The goal is to be a UI building block that achieves as close to a linearly-bijective mapping as possible.

## miwi/solidjs

Miwi UI components, ready for use in Solid.js projects.
